# 📊 Student Performance Analysis (Power BI Dashboard)


## 📝 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes the performance of 1,000 students based on gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation. Using interactive dashboards, key insights such as overall academic performance, performance gaps, and subject-wise trends are visualized. The goal is to uncover patterns that influence student achievement and provide actionable insights using data visualization and DAX in Power BI.
